# Multi-Stage Stochastic Programming
Asset-Liability Management (ALM) problems can be effectively addressed in Python through the implementation of compact and split variable models, utilizing the Pyomo optimization framework in conjunction with stochastic programming techniques. Stochastic programming encompasses methodologies such as chance-constrained programming and various scenario generation approaches. Specifically, scenario generation can be categorized into Two-Stage and Multi-Stage models.

In the context of scenario generation, each potential outcome of a stochastic parameter is represented as a distinct scenario. These scenarios are typically organized within a scenario tree structure. The primary objective of this framework is to identify optimal decision policies that maximize expected utility or fulfill specified objective functions across all scenarios. To tackle the intricacies of multi-stage problems, characterized by their complex structures, solution techniques such as compact models and split variables are employed, facilitating a more structured approach to optimization.
