# Multi-Stage Stochastic Programming
Asset-Liability Management (ALM) problems can be tackled in Python using a compact model or split variables model, implemented with Pyomo and stochastic programming. Stochastic programming, in turn, encompasses chance-constrained programming and scenario generation techniques. Scenario generation, specifically, can be approached using either Two-Stage or Multi-Stage models.

Within scenario generation, each potential outcome of an uncertain parameter is treated as a distinct scenario. Often, these scenarios are structured into a scenario tree. The goal is to identify the optimal strategy that maximizes the expected value or achieves the desired objective function across all scenarios. For solving multi-stage problems, which often have complex structures, techniques like the compact model and split variables are employed.
